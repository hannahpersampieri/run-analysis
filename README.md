# run-analysis
a Matlab program I wrote freshman year to analyze run data, scraped from a GPX file.
Gives average pace, distance, if you broke any records, and calorie burn. 
This was my first intro to coding, including functions and flow control.

It's not much, but it was what got me into coding, and got me an A :)
